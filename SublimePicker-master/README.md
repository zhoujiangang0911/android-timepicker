# SublimePicker

A customizable view that provisions picking of a date, time & recurrence option, all from a single user-interface. You can also view 'SublimePicker' as a collection of material-styled (API 22, & _not_ 21) DatePicker, TimePicker & RecurrencePicker, backported to API 16.

All three components have been converted to views, which enables us to add/embed them anywhere - add them to a 'Dialog', a 'PopupWindow', or use them as any regular android widget. 

Almost all styling possibilities have been exposed through attrs. If something has been missed, please bring it to my attention.

SublimePicker provides a single point of entry to all three pickers. What I mean is that once SublimePicker is available for interaction, the user can select a date, a time & a recurrence option without leaving the picker.
